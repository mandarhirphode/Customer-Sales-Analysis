Data Analytics Portfolio Project
Hey there! 👋 Welcome to my data playground. This project is a little journey from raw data to some pretty cool insights using Python, SQL, and Power BI.
Python Magic: I kicked things off by cleaning up the dataset and handling all those pesky missing values, getting everything ready for the spotlight.
SQL Adventures: Next up, I dove into SQL to dig out the meaningful insights hiding in the data. Think of it as turning raw info into a story you can actually use.
Power BI Showcase: Finally, I wrapped it all up by building interactive Power BI dashboards to bring those insights to life in a visual, easy-to-digest way.
Feel free to poke around the code and see how it all comes together. Enjoy!
